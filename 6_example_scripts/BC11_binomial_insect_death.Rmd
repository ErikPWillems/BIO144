# Introduction



# Insect death

The question is about the effects of three pesticides on the death of some
insects. The pesticides were applied at a range of different doses to
all of the individual insects in vial. This results in a dataset with
the pesticide used(called ``product''), the dose of that pesticide, the
number of individuals at the start of the experiment, and the number
that died. Hence its a dataset about who died and who lived, thus its a
dataset about binary data.

This might seem like a quite complex study (i.e., it has two explanatory
variables, one is continuous and the other is categorical), and you
might think that starting with a simpler study (e.g., one continuous
explanatory variable) might help you understand better. The reason we
start with this somewhat complex study is that the question is almost
identical in type to the ANCOVA in the previous chapter. Hence you
following and understanding this insect death example will required you
to understand and remember the ANCOVA example from the previous chapter.

Import that data:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
insect_death <- read_csv("new_pesticide_study.csv"), row.names=1)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
insect_death <- readr::read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/opetchey/BIO144/master/3_datasets/new_pesticide_study.csv")
```

```{r}
insect_death
```

# Various ways to express binary data

Each row of the dataset contains the results of a number of independent trials carried out at a particular dose (the `logdose` value) with one of the three products (the `product` value). In the first row (`product = "A"` and `logdose = -0.5`), for exmample, `n = 9` and `dead = 0`. There were 9 independent trials each involving an individual insect, and in none of those trials did an insect die. By contrast, the data in the 15th row shows 13 trials, and death of the insect in 12 of those.

An alternate expression of this data is to have one column be the number of successes (insect dies [this is test of an insecticide!]) and another column with number of failures.

```{r}
insect_death <- mutate(insect_death, successes=dead,
                       failures=n-dead)
```

We can also express the same data as proportion of successes and number of trials.

```{r}
insect_death <- mutate(insect_death, proportion_success=successes/n)
```

One more way to express this data is to have one row for each individual insect, and a column giving the outcome of that trial, containing either a zero (for failure) or a one (for success). Its not so easy to convert our current data into that format, so we won't. Just be aware that if you have that type of binary data, its just fine like that.

# Initial exploration

Now, of course, we make an exploratory graph. Lets make one with the
proportion dead at each treatment combination on the y-axis, `logdose` on the x-axis and colour the points by the `product`.

```{r}
ggplot(insect_death, aes(x=logdose, y=proportion_success, colour=product)) +
  geom_point() #+
  #geom_smooth()
```

What can we conclude from this graph? Well, more pesticide
equals greater death. Not so surprising. More interesting is the hint of
relatively high mortality at low doses of product B, and relatively low
mortality at high doses of product B. That is, it looks like the effect
of dose is different for product B, compared to A and C. This means we
expect a significant interaction between product and logdose in our
statistical model.

\subsection{Doing it wrong}\label{doing-it-wrong-1}

Lets ignore that we know its a bad idea to make a linear model of binary
data, just to see how bad things get. The most common method to make
such a linear model is to use a proportion as the response variable (actually, this is not quite true, as probably few would make such a heinous mistake, and would instead transform the proportion, but lets continue anyway). We
can use the proportion we already calculated, make the linear model, and then look at the model diagnostics.

```{r}
m1 <- lm(proportion_success ~ logdose * product, insect_death)
autoplot(m1)
```

Well, things look pretty bad in the residuals versus fitted values
graph, showing that a linear model of the proportion data is not well
justified. One solution is to apply a arcsine square root transformation
to the proportions, but this is unneccessary in this case, because we
have the binary data that underlies the proportions.

If we ignored the tcontinue and test the interaction term, we find it is not
significant, in contrast to what we guessed:

```{r}
anova(m1)
```

We can even make a version of the graph with the fitted lines.

```{r}
ggplot(insect_death, aes(x=logdose, y=proportion_success, colour=product)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method="lm")
```


This graph provides a good indication that a linear model is not
a very good idea with binary data. At low and high doses, the predicted
proportion of dead insects becomes less than 0 or greater than 1 (i.e.,
the lines go below 0 and above 1 on the y axis.). This is nonsense!
Proportions can't be less than zero or greater than 1. Seeing the
predictions of the statistical model straying outside the possible
range of the response variable is a good indication that the model is
inappropriate.



# Doing it right

## The binomial family

A much better model of the insect death data is a generalised linear
model with a binomial distribution family and logit link function. The
binomial distribution is just a distribution that describes the
probability of something happening. Drawing numbers from a binomial
distribution is just like flipping a coin:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
set.seed(1)
```

```{r}
rbinom(10, 1, 0.5)
```

Each of these number is effectively the toss of a coin, with 0 meaning
heads and 1 meaning tails (or the other way round).

The binomial distribution can have any probability, however. This would
be like if a coin is less likely to come up heads (zeros) than tails
(ones). In the following, we tell R that the coin comes up heads with
probabiliy 0.1:

```{r}
set.seed(2)
```

```{r}
rbinom(10, 1, 0.1)
```

We can use another function in R to ask how likely it is that a coin
comes up heads a specific number of times (call this H) when we toss it
a certain number of times (call this N) (here we assume the coin is perfectly fair so p = 0.5).

Here we ask, if we toss a fair coin 100 times, what is the chance that
we get exactly 50 heads and 50 tails? We answer this using R with:


```{r}
H <- 50
N = 100
p = 0.5
dbinom(H, N, p)
```

So, if we toss a fair coin 100 times, the probability of getting exactly 50 heads is about 0.08. Though it is the most probable of all outcomes, it is neverthess quite unlikely that we get exactly 50 heads and 50 tails! Getting 49 heads and 51 tails, for example, is less probable:

```{r}
dbinom(49, 100, 0.5)
```

The figure below shows on the y-axis the probability of getting numbers of
outcomes given on the x-axis.

Figure: Examples of the binomial distribution for 100 coin tosses, with three coins. The first coin is very biased (p = 0.1), the second less so (p = 0.25), and the third is fair (p = 0.5).

```{r}
count <- seq(0, 100, by=1)
layout(matrix(1:3, 1, 3))
plot(count, dbinom(count, 100, 0.1), main="Expectation = 0.1", type="l")
#arrows(count, rep(0, length(count)), count, dpois(count, 2), code=0)
plot(count, dbinom(count, 100, 0.25), main="Expectation = 0.25", type="l")
#arrows(count, rep(0, length(count)), count, dpois(count, 4), code=0)
plot(count, dbinom(count, 100, 0.5), main="Expectation = 0.5", type="l")
#arrows(count, rep(0, length(count)), count, dpois(count, 6), code=0)
```


## The logit link function

When we ask for a binomial glm, we automatically use the logit-link
function. But what is this. Simply put, its a mathematical function that
changes a probability (say \emph{p}) into a number that can take any
value, from - to + infinity. The function is
\(logit(p) = log(\frac{p}{1-p})\) and you can see it in the figure below. In
the insect mortality study, this link function changes the probability
of death (which ranges from 0 to 1) to a linear predictor scale that
goes from minus to plus infinity.


```{r}
library(boot)
y=seq(-15,15,length=100)
plot(inv.logit(y), y, type="l", xlab="Probability", ylab="Logit(probability)",
     xlim=c(-0.1, 1), ylim=c(-17, 15))
arrows(0.00, -16, 1, -16, code=3, col="red")
text(0.5,-15, "Response scale")
arrows(-0.07, -17, -0.07, 15, code=3, col="cornflowerblue")
text(-0.05, 10, "Linear predictor scale", adj=0)
```


# Making and interpreting the binomial

Then we make the general linear model with binomial distribution family:

```{r}
m1 <-glm(cbind(successes, failures) ~ logdose * product,
         data = insect_death, family = "binomial")
```

Note that when we ask for the binomial distribution, glm automatically
uses the logit link function.

```{r}
autoplot(m1)
```

The diagnostic plots look fine. So we can continue with
the interpretation of the model. First the analysis of deviance table:

```{r}
anova(m1, test="Chisq")
```

We are reminded of the model (binomial with a logit link), of the
response variable (\texttt{cbind(dead, alive}), and that terms are added
sequentially, which means that logdose is added to the null model, then
product is added to the model containing logdose, and then the
interaction between logdose and product is added to this.

Adding logdose to the model explains 475.91 units of deviance, out of the
total of 541.46. This is a lot, and confirms only that higher doses of
pesticides tend to kill more insects; this is not so surprising or
interesting! (Adding `logdose` is like adding a single regression line to
the graph.)

Adding the product term to the model explains 0.71 units of deviance, a
very small amount. (Adding product to a model with logdose is like
putting three regression lines with the same slope.)

Adding the interaction between logdose and product (which allow each of
the three regression lines to have a different slope) explains 9.19
units of deviance, which is a reasonable amount. This suggests that allowing
different slopes is appropriate / necessary. The biological
interpretation of this is that the effect of logdose on mortality
differs among pesticides. This is what we guessed when we first
visualised the data.

Recall that these deviances are log likelihoods, and we can test the difference in deviance between two models by looking at the ratio of their likelihoods. First we make a model without the interaction:

```{r}
m2 <-glm(cbind(successes, failures) ~ logdose + product,
         data = insect_death, family = "binomial")
```

And then use the anova function to compare them:
```{r}
anova(m1, m2, test="Chisq")
```

(Technical detail: using the difference in log likelihoods is equivalent to using the log of the ratio of the likelihoods. log(A) - log(B) = log(A / B))

And now lets interpret the coefficients table:

```{r}
summary(m1)
```

There is the usual reminder of the model and information about the
residuals. Then comes the coefficients.

The first is the intercept, which is for product A (because A is before
B and C in the alphabet -- R works alphabetically with factors, unless
we tell it otherwise). The estimate for this intercept is negative,
which may seem odd as the response is about proportion dead so should be
bounded between 0 and 1. But remember the logit link function is being
used and the intercept coefficient is on the scale of the linear
predictor, which is the logit of the proportion.

Next is the the logdose coefficient is the slope of the relationship
between proportion dead and logdose for product A.

As in the ANCOVA example in the previous chapter (the limpet fecundity
study) the productB coefficient and the productC coefficients are about
the difference between the intercept of these products from the
intercept for product A. And the logdose:productB and logdose:productC
coefficients are the difference between the slope between product A and
product B, and product A and product C, respectively. The table confirms
what we suspected, that the relationship between mortality and logdose
is different for product B, and the negative coefficient tells us the
relationship is weaker (again we already guessed this).

Just as in the poisson example, we need to check if the data is
overdispersed relative to the binomial distribution assumption, and do
this in the same way, by dividing the residual deviance by the residual
degrees of freedom:

```{r}
summary(m1)$deviance / summary(m1)$df.residual
```

This is within the 0.9 to 1.1 limit, so we can be happy the data is not
overdispersed.

# Making a beautiful graph

Lets use our usual workflow to add the model fits to the graph, and also
the summary statistics.

```{r}
new_data <- expand.grid(logdose=seq(min(insect_death$logdose),
                                    max(insect_death$logdose), length=100),
                    product=unique(insect_death$product))
p1 <- predict(m1, newdata = new_data, type="response", se.fit=TRUE)
n1 <- cbind(new_data, p1)
ggplot(insect_death, aes(x=logdose, y=proportion_success, fill=product)) +
  xlab("Log insecticide concentration") +
  ylab("Proportion of insects dead") +
  geom_smooth(data=n1, aes(y=fit, ymin=fit-se.fit, ymax=fit+se.fit, colour=product),
              stat="identity") +
  geom_point(pch=21, size=2)


```
