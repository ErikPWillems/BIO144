## Overarching goals of the course



* Provide a \textcolor{blue}{solid foundation} for answering biological questions with quantitative data.  
* Help students to understand the \textcolor{blue}{language of a statistician.}  
* Ability to understand and interpret results \textcolor{blue}{in research articles.}  
* Give the students a \textcolor{blue}{challenging, engaging, and enjoyable} learning experience.  

\  



## Why is statistical data analysis so relevant for the biological and medical sciences?  

Only with knowledge of data and statistical data analysis will it be possible to  analyze your data from Bachelor, Master or PhD theses.... 

* \textcolor{blue}{Medicine:} What is the effect of a drug? Which factors cause cancer?
* __Ecology:__ What is a suitable habitat for a certain animal? Which resources does it need or prefer?
* \textcolor{red}{Evoloutionary biology:} Do highly inbred animals have decreased chances to survive or reproduce?  

## Data and statistics are essential  

A good foundation in statistics \textcolor{blue}{makes you more independent} from consultants or the goodwill of colleagues. Without such a knowledge, you will have to heavily rely on and trust others.

Data analysis/statistics is itself an exciting part of research! 
 
Data analysis is at the \textcolor{blue}{interface between mathematics and biology/medicine} (and many other applied research fields).


## Examples of insights from data

\alert{Otter (lutra lutra)}

\colorbox{lightgray}{\begin{minipage}{14cm}
\textit{Research questions}: What is the preferred habitat by otters? How do otters adapt to human altered landscapes?
\end{minipage}}

_Method:_ Study in Austria, 9 Otter were radio-tracked and monitored during 2-3 years.

## 

\alert{Inbreeding in Alpine ibex}

\colorbox{lightgray}{\begin{minipage}{14cm}
\emph{Research question:} Does inbreeding in Alpine ibex populations have a negative effect on long-term population growth? Inbreeding depression!
\end{minipage}}  

\begin{multicols}{2}
\emph{Methods:} Genetic information from blood samples allow to quantify the level of inbreeding in each ibex population. In addition, long-term monitoring of population sizes and harvest rates.

\end{multicols} 

## \alert{Mercury (Hg) in the soil}

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=8cm]{pictures/wallis.png}
\end{center}

\colorbox{lightgray}{\begin{minipage}{14cm}
\emph{Research question:} Is the Hg level in the environment (soil) of people's homes associated to the Hg levels in their bodies (urin, hair)?
\end{minipage}}

_Method:_ Measurements of Hg concentrations on people's properties, as well as measurements and survey of children and their mothers living in these properties.

Highly delicate, emotionally charged, political question!

## 

\alert{Physical activity in children (Splashy study)}

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=6cm]{pictures/kids.jpg}  

{\scriptsize splashy.ch}
\end{center}

\colorbox{lightgray}{\begin{minipage}{14cm}
\emph{Research question:} Which factors influence physical activity patterns in children aged 2-6 years?
\end{minipage}}

_Method:_ The children had to wear accelerometers for several days. In addition, their parents had to fill in a detailed questionnaire.  

Observed variables were, e.g., media consumption, behavior of the parents, age, weight, social structure,...

## Producing nonsense with statistics... 

... is too easy ...  

\  

A profound knowledge of data analysis and statistics protects you from producing nonsense -- and helps to detect it. See for example:

## How do we get insights from data...

**... rather than nonsense.**

* Excellent data management practices.
* Informative graphical visualisations to explore data.
* Informative numerical summarise to explore data.
* Appropriate transformations of data.
* Appropriate statistics tests / models.

**Awareness of our "realm":**

* Description of patterns, including associations (we will do this).
* Predicting (we will do this).
* Inferring causation (we will do this, by analysing experiments randomised manipulations).



## What is a model?

A model is an approximation of the reality. __Understanding how the real world works__ is usually only possible thanks to simplifying assumptions.

$\rightarrow$ This is exactly __the purpose of statistical data analysis.__

In 2014, David Hand wrote:

_In general, when building statistical models, we must
not forget that the aim is to understand something about
the real world. Or predict, choose an action, make
a decision, summarize evidence, and so on, but always
about the real world, not an abstract mathematical
world: our models are not the reality -- a point well
made by George Box in his often-cited remark that_
\alert{"all
models are wrong, but some are useful."}
<!--\citep{box1979}.}_-->

## Goals of the course (part 2)

By the end of the course you will be able

* to \textcolor{blue}{analyze} all data examples introduced here using R (and of course many more),
* to \textcolor{blue}{report and interpret} the results,
* to \textcolor{blue}{draw conclusions} from them,
* to give \textcolor{blue}{graphical descriptions} of the data and the results,
* to \textcolor{blue}{be critical} about what you see.

## Graphical representation of data

You should remember the following options for graphical data descriptions. Several of them appeared already in previous examples.

\begin{tabular}{ll}
Representation & Useful for \\
\hline
 Scatterplots & Pairwise dependency of continuous \\
    &  variables. \\[1mm]
 Histograms & Distribution of continuous variables.\\[1mm]
 Boxplots  & Distribution of continuous variables, ev. \\
    & conditionally on categories.\\[1mm]
\hline
\end{tabular}


## A career in visualising data??!!

There are many "fancy" ways to graphically display data (__nice-to-know__):

* 3D-plots
* Spatial representations (using geodata)
* Interactive graphs and animations

Many R packages are available for various purposes. Interactive apps can, for example, be generated with Shiny. Check out the shiny gallery:

## Next week: Simple linear regression

It will be partially a repetition of what you heard in Mat183, chapter 10.2.
